# United-States-Presidential-Elections-Data-Analysis

**Dataset**: We have used the data from past United States presidential elections collected from The American Presidency Project (https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/) to run an analysis. 

We want to assess the following:  
1. Does the incumbent party (either Republican or Democrat) have an effect on the percentage of vote share during elections?  
2. How do the civil war (either Confederate or Union) states vote for incumbents?  
3. Does there exist some interaction between incumbency and civil war states?
